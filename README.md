# Text Editor



## User Story
This is a progressive web app (PWA), which is a web application that is designed to work offline and provide a native app-like experience to users.

IndexedDB is a browser-based database that allows web applications to store and retrieve large amounts of structured data, including files and objects. It's a key component of many PWAs because it allows the app to function offline, even when the user is not connected to the internet. The idb package is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API that provides a simplified interface for storing and retrieving data, making it easier for developers to work with.

Using IndexedDB as a data persistence technique provides redundancy in case one of the other options (such as local storage or cookies) is not supported by the user's browser. This helps ensure that the application can continue to function even if the user is using an older or less common browser.
